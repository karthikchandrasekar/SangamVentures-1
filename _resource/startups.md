<ul>
  <li>Are you a technical founder or founding team building a STEM-led technology to tackle climate change? </li>
  <li>Are you building a solution something that has an immediate need or addresses a significant gap in the market today but not considered “cool” or “hot” by the venture community?</li>
  <li>Are you focused on product-market fit and meaningful value proposition to the customers you serve and healthy unit economics that you can scale?</li>
  <li>Are you taking a customer-driven contrarian view to building your venture i.e. are you driven by solving a problem for a customer base that you want to tackle over chasing valuations?</li>
</ul>
