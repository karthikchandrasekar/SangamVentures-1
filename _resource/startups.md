Are you a start-up?</p>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you a technical founder or founding team building a STEM-led technology to tackle climate change?</li>
  <li>Are you building a solution that has an immediate need or addresses a significant gap in the market today but not considered “cool” or “hot” by the venture community?</li>
  <li>Are you focused on product-market fit and meaningful value proposition to the customers you serve and healthy unit economics that you can scale?</li>
  <li>Are you taking a customer-driven contrarian view to building your venture i.e. solving a real customer problem rather than chasing valuations?</li>
</ul>

  We would love to speak with you! <br>
  Here is what you can expect from us:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are open to invest by ourselves. We can also lead rounds even if your capital requirement is higher than what we can invest.</li>
  <li>We don’t care about who else is investing — we look for founders with high conviction, deep technical competency, and willingness to be contrarian.</li>
  <li>We will want to speak to some (potential) customers to understand how close or far you are from product-market fit.</li>
  <li>We want our founders to stay lean and reduce technology + market risk by focusing intensely on product development and customer validation.</li>
  <li>We want to learn what drives you and your long-term vision. We only invest when your vision aligns with our thesis — and we will openly share our thesis in your sector.</li>
</ul>
