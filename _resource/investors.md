cta-heading: "Are you an Investor?"
cta-description: "Are you investing for posterity? Are you looking to invest into the transition from an extractive and consumeristic society to a society that is more mindful of its impact on the environment and thoughtful in its choices? We want to hear from you!"
cta-button-text: "Reach out to us!"

questions:
    - "Where is the fund incorporated and why did we choose that domicile?"
    - "Why are you focused on Seed and Early stage startups?"
    - "How do you source deals? Can we get good pipeline?"
answers:
    - "Sangam is domiciled in Mauritius for the flexibility to invest across the Indian sub-continent and in global start-ups targeting our Markets. Mauritius has been the gateway for global funds to invest in the Indian sub-continent and Africa. We picked Mauritius as the domicile for its strong experience of supporting fund management businesses and the flexibility it provides for fund structures and strategy, like open-ended funds and the Protected Cell Company, over what were available under Indian regulation at the time"
    - "We see too many investors lament that there are not enough investment ready start-ups while start-ups complain that investors keep waiting and watching for the start-ups to become investment ready. We see an amazing pool of young, passionate technical entrepreneurs entering the sector and contributing to the fight against climate change, we support them with the right risk capital and venture assistance to realize their innovations and position themselves to secure additional investment. We are in-effect fighting the streetlight effect (see below)
      <br> <h5 style='text-align:center; margin-top:2rem;'>The streetlight effect, or the drunkard's search principle</h5> <img src='https://karthikchandrasekar.github.io/SangamVentures-1/images/illustrations/streetlighteffect.png' style='max-width:100%; height:auto; display:block; margin:1rem auto;'>"
    - "We proactively source deals based on thesis deep dives by the team into specific
      problem spaces where we cold-call start-up founders or use our networks to find
      the most compelling start-ups. When we feel that the thesis might be nascent in
      the region, we run incubation and acceleration programs to build a pipeline of
      potential start-ups through our in-house incubator, AIC-Sangam. In such cases,
      we might get start-ups that have been significantly de-risked by the incubation
      team’s work with them over a period of 3–9 months before we invest. We also get
      significant inbound deal flow from the venture community, multiple angel investors,
      and a network of incubators and accelerators that we work closely with."
