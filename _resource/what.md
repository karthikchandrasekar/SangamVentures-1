At Sangam, we work across the climate impact spectrum from mitigation to adaptation. 
Our first goal is to mitigate the greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere either by abating new emissions released into the atmosphere or sequestering it and ideally reversing it. We believe that a lot of our mitigation investments will be driven by engineering challenges and shifting consumer and producer behaviours or choices. The Fund will do this by providing patient capital without overlooking the urgency of the matter. 
Our second and harder goal is facilitating climate change adaptation. Here we seek to serve low-income and marginalized communities in the target markets, who are being significantly affected by climate change already. Here we are fighting market failures and a failure of vision in our markets to create economic pathways for all. Not building climate change resilience in the communities we serve will negate all the development gains from the last few decades. 
We expect our portfolio will provide the pathways for long-term climate change mitigation and creating climate-resilient communities that are inclusive in nature.
