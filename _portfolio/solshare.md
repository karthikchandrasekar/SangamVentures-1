SolShare is leading the Energiewende by developing services backbone for the future of utilities.

We invested in SolShare to work with them to create a more decentralized energy where shared infrastructure democratizes access to energy for all. 

A big part of our investment thesis is the rise of the prosumer and the creation of more digital public infrastructure.

The utility ecosystem is one of the hardest to disrupt even through there is a significant opportunity to provide a better customer experperience!

What is the expectation from the investment - are we waiting for the global markets to mature?
