Delectrik was founded in 2016 with a vision to provide sustainable and affordable electricity to Businesses and Individuals via Decentralized Electricity systems.

The major challenge in widespread adoption of renewable sources such as solar/wind is its intermittency and inability to store the energy for latter use. The existing energy storage batteries are expensive and lasts for few years and thus are consumables. Delectrik’s products when combined with renewables provides for 24×7 clean energy thereby mitigating the use of fossil fuels and its harmful effect on climate and provides affordable electricity to its users.

Delectrik is headquartered in India with an overseas subsidiary in Australia, currently supplies Flow Batteries to 9 countries across 5 continents (North America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa) ranging from 10 kWh to multi MWh capacity

Delectrik’s products are based on vanadium redox chemistry and falls into the general class of redox flow batteries. This class of battery employs an electrolyte where energy is stored and a cell stack where energy conversion occurs. Energy is stored chemically in different ionic forms of vanadium in a dilute acid electrolyte. The electrolyte is pumped from separate plastic storage tanks into flow cells across a membrane where one form of electrolyte is electrochemically oxidized, and the other is electrochemically reduced. This creates a current that is collected by electrodes and made available to an external circuit. The reaction is reversible allowing the battery to be charged and discharged.
