Voltrez Tech is a DeepTech start-up focused on commercializing a new anode chemistry to tackle one of the hardest problems in lithium-ion batteries – dendrite formation. Through their novel anode, Voltrez is working to prevent dendrite growth and the associated risks across a range of chemistries, including NMC, NCA, LFP, LMFP, and Sodium. The versatility of their solution extends to compatibility with various electrolytes (liquid, semi-solid, and solid), and it is also independent of cathode chemistry. Their work focuses on controlling the internal electrochemical processes that lead to dendrite formation, thereby improving both the safety and longevity of batteries. Their innovative anode technology is designed to mitigate the safety risks commonly associated with fast-charging cells. The team is now using the dendrite free chemistry platform to enable ultra-fast charging. This technology maintains the use of graphite as the dominant anode material, ensuring cost-effectiveness compared to other alternatives

We invested in a talented team of technologists at Voltrez, who are tackling one of the most critical challenges in the global battery market - safety. As demand for batteries and mass-market manufacturing grows across a range of applications, from household appliances to electric vehicles, ensuring battery safety is an absolute necessity, rather than a luxury.

Voltrez is well-positioned to capitalize on this rising demand by developing innovative solutions that not only address safety but also enhance performance. Their cutting-edge approach to battery technology puts them on the path to becoming a global leader in the industry. With their forward-thinking strategies, Voltrez has the potential to emerge as one of the top battery companies coming out of India, pioneering advancements that could significantly impact the future of energy storage globally.
